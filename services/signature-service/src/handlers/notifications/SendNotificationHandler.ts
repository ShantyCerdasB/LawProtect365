/**
 * TODO: SendNotificationHandler Responsibilities Analysis
 * 
 * WHAT THIS HANDLER DOES:
 * ✅ Sends reminders to signers who haven't signed
 * ✅ Resends invitations to specific signers
 * ✅ Validates envelope exists and is sent
 * ✅ Validates user has permission to send notifications
 * ✅ Logs notification activity for audit
 * ✅ Tracks notification frequency and limits
 * 
 * WHAT THIS HANDLER DOES NOT DO:
 * ❌ Handle document signing (that's SignDocumentHandler)
 * ❌ Manage email delivery (that's Notification Service)
 * ❌ Handle user authentication (that's Auth Service)
 * ❌ Generate invitation tokens (that's CreateEnvelopeHandler)
 * 
 * POTENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONCERNS:
 * ⚠️  Sends reminders AND resends invitations - could be split
 * ⚠️  Validates permissions AND sends notifications - could be separate
 * 
 * RECOMMENDATION: Keep as single handler - notifications are atomic operations
