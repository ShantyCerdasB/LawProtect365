/**
 * TODO: GetEnvelopeHandler Responsibilities Analysis
 * 
 * WHAT THIS HANDLER DOES:
 * ✅ Retrieves envelope details from database
 * ✅ Includes signer status and progress
 * ✅ Includes document metadata
 * ✅ Validates user has access to envelope
 * ✅ Returns formatted response for frontend
 * ✅ Includes signing progress and statistics
 * 
 * WHAT THIS HANDLER DOES NOT DO:
 * ❌ Modify envelope data (that's UpdateEnvelopeHandler)
 * ❌ Handle document content (that's Document Service)
 * ❌ Manage user authentication (that's Auth Service)
 * ❌ Generate audit events (read-only operation)
 * 
 * POTENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONCERNS:
 * ⚠️  Retrieves envelope AND signers - could be split
 * ⚠️  Validates access AND returns data - could be separate
 * 
 * RECOMMENDATION: Keep as single handler - read operations are simple
