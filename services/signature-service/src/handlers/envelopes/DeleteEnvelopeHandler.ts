/**
 * TODO: DeleteEnvelopeHandler Responsibilities Analysis
 * 
 * WHAT THIS HANDLER DOES:
 * ✅ Validates envelope exists and is in DRAFT status
 * ✅ Deletes envelope from database
 * ✅ Cleans up related signers
 * ✅ Cleans up invitation tokens
 * ✅ Generates audit events for deletion
 * ✅ Validates user has permission to delete
 * 
 * WHAT THIS HANDLER DOES NOT DO:
 * ❌ Delete sent/completed envelopes (business rule)
 * ❌ Handle document deletion (that's Document Service)
 * ❌ Manage user permissions (that's Auth Service)
 * ❌ Send notifications (not needed for deletion)
 * 
 * POTENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONCERNS:
 * ⚠️  Deletes envelope AND cleans up related data - could be split
 * ⚠️  Validates permissions AND deletes - could be separate
 * 
 * RECOMMENDATION: Keep as single handler - deletion is atomic operation
