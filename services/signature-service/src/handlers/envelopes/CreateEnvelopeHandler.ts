/**
 * TODO: CreateEnvelopeHandler Responsibilities Analysis
 * 
 * WHAT THIS HANDLER DOES:
 * ✅ Creates new envelope with document and metadata
 * ✅ Creates all signers with their information
 * ✅ Generates invitation tokens for external signers
 * ✅ Validates business rules (max signers, document exists, etc.)
 * ✅ Stores envelope and signers in database
 * ✅ Generates audit events for creation
 * ✅ Returns created envelope with signers
 * 
 * WHAT THIS HANDLER DOES NOT DO:
 * ❌ Send emails (that's SendEnvelopeHandler)
 * ❌ Validate document content (that's Document Service)
 * ❌ Handle file uploads (that's Document Service)
 * ❌ Manage user authentication (that's Auth Service)
 * 
 * POTENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONCERNS:
 * ⚠️  Generates tokens AND creates envelope - could be split
 * ⚠️  Validates business rules AND stores data - could be split
 * ⚠️  Creates envelope AND signers - could be separate operations
 * 
 * RECOMMENDATION: Keep as single handler - envelope creation is atomic
