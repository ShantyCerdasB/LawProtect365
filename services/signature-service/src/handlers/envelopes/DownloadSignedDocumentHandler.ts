/**
 * TODO: DownloadSignedDocumentHandler Responsibilities Analysis
 * 
 * WHAT THIS HANDLER DOES:
 * ✅ Validates user has access to signed document
 * ✅ Retrieves signed document from S3
 * ✅ Generates presigned URL for download
 * ✅ Logs download activity for audit
 * ✅ Validates document is completed and signed
 * ✅ Returns download URL with expiration
 * 
 * WHAT THIS HANDLER DOES NOT DO:
 * ❌ Handle document signing (that's SignDocumentHandler)
 * ❌ Manage document storage (that's Document Service)
 * ❌ Handle file uploads (that's Document Service)
 * ❌ Manage user permissions (that's Auth Service)
 * 
 * POTENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONCERNS:
 * ⚠️  Validates access AND generates download URL - could be split
 * ⚠️  Logs audit AND returns data - could be separate
 * 
 * RECOMMENDATION: Keep as single handler - download is atomic operation
