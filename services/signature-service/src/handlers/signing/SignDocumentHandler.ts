/**
 * TODO: SignDocumentHandler Responsibilities Analysis
 * 
 * WHAT THIS HANDLER DOES:
 * ✅ Validates signer consent and intent
 * ✅ Processes digital signature creation
 * ✅ Updates signer status to SIGNED
 * ✅ Creates signature record in database
 * ✅ Stores signed document in S3
 * ✅ Updates envelope progress and status
 * ✅ Generates audit events for signing
 * ✅ Handles KMS signing operations
 * ✅ Validates signature integrity
 * 
 * WHAT THIS HANDLER DOES NOT DO:
 * ❌ Send notifications (that's Notification Service)
 * ❌ Handle document content (that's Document Service)
 * ❌ Manage user authentication (that's Auth Service)
 * ❌ Handle invitation tokens (that's ViewDocumentHandler)
 * 
 * POTENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONCERNS:
 * ⚠️  Processes consent AND creates signature - could be split
 * ⚠️  Updates signer AND envelope status - could be separate
 * ⚠️  Handles KMS AND S3 operations - could be split
 * ⚠️  Validates AND stores signature - could be separate
 * 
 * RECOMMENDATION: Consider splitting - this handler has many responsibilities
 * SUGGESTED SPLIT:
 * - SignDocumentHandler (consent + signature creation)
 * - UpdateSignerStatusHandler (status updates)
 * - StoreSignatureHandler (S3 + KMS operations)
